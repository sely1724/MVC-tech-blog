# 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

## Your Task

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

Your task this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a CMS-style blog site

TO DO:

1. Set Up Dashboard
2. Set up Dashboard Posting Ability
3. Set up ability to view and add comments when looking at single post
4. Create CSS
5. Set up Idle Time to logout
6. Set up ability to delete/edit post from my dashboard

TO DO: On Homepage - add date created to blog posts
TO DO: When Taken to individual Post - CHECK FOR LOGIN PROMPT - if logged in show title, content, post creator's username, and date for the post.
TO DO: When taken to individual POST have option to leave comment.

WHEN I enter a comment and click on the submit button while signed in
THEN the comment is saved and the post is updated to display the comment, the comment creator’s username, and the date created
WHEN I click on the dashboard option in the navigation
THEN I am taken to the dashboard and presented with any blog posts I have already created and the option to add a new blog post
WHEN I click on the button to add a new blog post
THEN I am prompted to enter both a title and contents for my blog post
WHEN I click on the button to create a new blog post
THEN the title and contents of my post are saved and I am taken back to an updated dashboard with my new blog post
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Getting Started

Your application’s folder structure must follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. You’ll need to use the [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) package to implement Handlebars.js for your Views, use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

You’ll also need the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables, the [bcrypt package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash passwords, and the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) and [connect-session-sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize) packages to add authentication.

**Note**: The [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) package stores the session data on the client in a cookie. When you are idle on the site for more than a set time, the cookie will expire and you will be required to log in again to start a new session. This is the default behavior and you do not have to do anything to your application other than implement the npm package.

## Grading Requirements

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> - A repository that has no code
>
> - A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> - A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> - A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

  - Application must be deployed to Heroku.

### Deployment: 32%

- Application deployed at live URL.

- Application loads with no errors.

- Application GitHub URL submitted.

- GitHub repository contains application code.

### Application Quality: 15%

- User experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.
